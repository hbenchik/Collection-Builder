The digital collection consists of images and descriptions of 30 different species of butterflies from North America and the United Kingdom, which derive from three different books, all of which can be found in rare books from the Lilly Library at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN. These three books and their authors are as follows:

•	The natural history of British butterflies by James Duncan

•	American butterflies and moths by Cecile Hulse Matschat

•	Beautiful butterflies: the British species described and illustrated: with an introductory chapter containing the history of a butterfly through all its changes and transformations by H.G. Adams
