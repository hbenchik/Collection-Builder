## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

{% This digital collection is intended to serve as a compendium and complementary resource to the “Flora and Fauna” exhibition from the Lilly Library, which was on display from February 2023 to August 2023. In this digital collection, users can observe how butterflies are depicted in rare books at the Lilly Library. Furthermore, users will be able to see how these depictions of butterflies relate to the “Flora and Fauna” exhibition in addition to being able to explore various species of butterflies and different data about them. As materials from the “Flora and Fauna” exhibition are archived on the Lilly Library’s website, users will be able to use this digital collection as a means of studying and analyzing different types of butterflies, which serve as a natural bridge between the flora and fauna. %}
