{% include feature/nav-menu.html sections="This project is intended to enhance the “Flora and Fauna” exhibition that was on display at the Lilly Library from February to August of 2023. Since butterflies, in some respects, serve as a bridge between flora and fauna as insects that pollinate flowers, the digitization of different species of butterflies in the U.S. and the U.K. can enrich the visual and contextual properties of the exhibition’s materials. Since butterflies are also beautiful and unique themselves, independent of context, the digital collection can also serve as a stand-alone exhibition for a variety of audiences.![image](https://github.com/hbenchik/Collection-Builder/assets/142824190/6f8d5d64-ebe8-4aef-8026-54077df6d3a9)
