## About the Website

This digital collection is intended to serve as a compendium and complementary resource to the “Flora and Fauna” exhibition from the Lilly Library, which was on display from February 2023 to August 2023. In this digital collection, users can observe how butterflies are depicted in rare books at the Lilly Library. Furthermore, users will be able to see how these depictions of butterflies relate to the “Flora and Fauna” exhibition in addition to being able to explore various species of butterflies and different data about them. As materials from the “Flora and Fauna” exhibition are archived on the Lilly Library’s website, users will be able to use this digital collection as a means of studying and analyzing different types of butterflies, which serve as a natural bridge between the flora and fauna.

There will be two intended groups of users for this digital collection. The first group of users includes scientific and academic scholars, researchers, and professors, particularly biologists and zoologists who wish to get a better understanding of different species of butterflies in the U.S. and the U.K. Because the digital collection will allow users to compare the butterflies to each other in addition to listing their size, life span, habitat, and other important details, this collection could be a beneficial resource to biologists with an interest in butterflies. 

The second group of users includes those who just like butterflies and think they are beautiful to look at. This audience will be much wider in scope but will be intended to focus on those ages 10-22 and those ages 40-65. This audience is expected to pay more attention to the images of the butterflies as opposed to their information and statistics.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

## Technical and Metadata Standards

The technical and metadata standards contained in this collection were modeled after a metadata application profile built for this project. This originally included 15 elements, all of which were mapped to their corresponding Dublin Core elements. Other technical and metadata standards include use of Library of Congress Subject Headings for the countries of origin element, matching the capitalization of the book titles to those found in the Lilly Library's catalog, the inclusion of DCMI vocabulary for the type element, and the use of ISO 639-2 Codes for the Representation of Names and Lanuages for the language element. Additionally, this collection implements various technical elements from Collection Builder Docs, including the creation of addition pages, liquid elements, and the use of an interactive map to show the book's locations.
